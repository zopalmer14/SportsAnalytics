# STAT1341-Sports-Analytics
The Homework directory contains all of the 12 homework assignments (7 so far) we had throughout the semester that involve analysis of various sports using certain metrics or models to gauge and analyze individual player or team performance both prospectively and retrospectively.

The Projects directory includes both my midterm and final projects for the course (only the midterm so far). The midterm projects looks into the impact of aging on player performance.
